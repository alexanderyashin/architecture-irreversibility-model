  "title": "Architecture Irreversibility Model: Thresholds, Cascades, and Expected Loss",
  "description": "A quantitative model for irreversible transitions in complex architectures. The repository provides a reproducible simulation framework demonstrating threshold crossings, dependency-driven cascades, and expected economic loss on fully synthetic data. This is a public showcase and research artifact; no proprietary calibration or consulting logic is included.",
